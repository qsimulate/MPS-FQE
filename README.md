# MPS-FQE
The Matrix Product State Fermionic Quantum Emulator (MPS-FQE) delivers a matrix product state backend to the [Openfermion-FQE](https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-FQE) fermionic circuit simulator.

## Getting Started
(NOT CORRECT STATEMENT)
Installing MPS-FQE can be done via `pip install mps-fqe`.

## How to contribute
(SHOULD THIS BE THE SAME AS FQE CONTRIBUTIONS GUIDELINES?)
We'd love to accept your contributions and patches to MPS-FQE. 
There are a few small guidelines you need to follow. 
Contributions to MPS-FQE must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement. 
You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution, this simply gives us permission 
to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. 
Head over to https://cla.developers.google.com/ to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. 
We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests. 
Furthermore, please make sure your new code comes with extensive tests! We use automatic testing to 
make sure all pull requests pass tests and do not decrease overall test coverage by too much. 
Make sure you adhere to our style guide. Just have a look at our code for clues. 
We mostly follow PEP 8 and use the corresponding linter to check for it. 
Code should always come with documentation, which is generated automatically and can be found here.

We use Github issues for tracking requests and bugs.
